# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-Project-data-sci

This repository contains a machine learning model designed to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. The model is trained using a dataset that includes both legitimate and fraudulent transactions. It aims to identify suspicious transactions in real time to help prevent fraudulent activity.
Dataset The dataset used in this project is the Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset from Kaggle. It contains over 280,000 transactions, with a small percentage (0.17%) being fraudulent.
Features: The dataset contains 31 features, including transaction amount, time, and 28 anonymized features resulting from a PCA transformation. Target Variable: The target variable is binary (0 for legitimate transactions and 1 for fraudulent transactions). Note: The dataset has been preprocessed, including standard scaling and feature engineering, to remove any sensitive information.
in this project, Decision Tree Classifier machine learning models is used
Result : After evaluating the models, the following performance metrics were achieved: Accuracy: 99.85 % precision: 99.77 % Recall: 99.92 % F1 Score: 99.85 %
deployment planning can deploy the model by using streamlit
